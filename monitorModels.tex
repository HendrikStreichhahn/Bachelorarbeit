\section{TeSSLa}

TeSSLa (\textbf{Te}mporal \textbf{S}tream-based \textbf{S}pecification \textbf{La}nguage) is a functional programming language, build for runtime verification of streams. In TeSSLa, streams are defined as traces of events, each event consists of one data value from a data set $\mathbb D$ and a time value from a discrete time domain $\mathbb T$. This time domain needs a total order and subsequent timestamps must have increasing time values. A TeSSLa Specification can have several streams with different data sets, but each of these streams must use the same time domain $\mathbb T$, which timestamps are increasing over all streams. Each stream can have only one event per timestamp, but it is possible to have events on different streams at the same timestamp.\\
A distinction between synchronous and asynchronous streams is made. A set of synchronous streams have events in the exact same time stamps, events in asynchronous streams do not have this restriction. It is easy to see, that synchronous streams are a subset of the asynchronous ones, therefore we will only use asynchronous streams from now on.\\
In TeSSLa, calculations are done, when new events are arriving. Based on the specification, output streams are generated with events on the same timestamps as the used input streams, but filtering is possible, where not all input events produce output events. With the \emph{delay}-operator, it is possible to create new timestamps. This possibility will take a large role in this thesis, more on that later.\\
At the timestamps, in which events arrived and calculations are done, you only have direct access to the youngest event of each stream, but with the use of the \emph{last}-operator, which can be used recursively, the event before that can be accessed. The \emph{lift}-operator applies a function, which is defined on data values $\mathbb D$, on each event of one or more streams. Similar to this, the \emph{slift}-operator (signal lift) first applies the given function, when there was at least one event of each input stream. The \emph{time}-operator returns the time value of an event.\\

%In ~\cite{TeSSLa} werden verschiedene Fragmente von TeSSLa beschrieben, die unterschiedliche Mächtigkeiten haben und äquivalent zu verschiedenen Transduktormodellen sind. Im Fragment \emph{TeSSLa$_{bool}$} sind die Datentypmengen der Ströme auf boolesche Werte beschränkt, als Operatoren sind nur der oben genannte \emph{last}-Operator, der \emph{lift}-Operator
